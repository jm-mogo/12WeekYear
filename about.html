        <h2>Why I made this site</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve set a lot of goals in my life, and even when I’ve accomplished some of them, those last
            years I
            haven’t been organized with my priorities. So, this year I set some goals (actually last year
            goals).
            But this time I’m committed to accomplish them. It’s the second month of the year and though I’ve made some
            advancement,
            I
            could still do better, I could focus more, and get things done.
        </p>

            Well, this week I found a method to set goals, it’s called “The 12 week year”. I read the book in two days,
            and
            I’m
            ready to start applaying it next week. I want to document all the process, so that I can see all my
            progress, the areas I
            could
            improve, and of course, share it all with you, whether now or in the future.
