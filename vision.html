        <h2>My vision of the future</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-title">Code</h3>
        <p> I want to get a job a web developer, actually any job code related would be great. The payment in the IT
            industry is good, and programmin is something I’m very interested knowing how it all works, and building
            useful
            tools aka software would be great. Also, it’s a job that would give me the freedom, not just in the
            financial sense, but also free time to do other things that I do enjoy, like making music, and learning.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-title">Language</h3>
        <p>I wan to talk three or more languages. I already speak English, and Spanish is my native language. So, I
            would
            like to expand my comprehension of the world through acquiring a new language, and I love Japanese. I
            will
            be devoting enough time to make this dream come true. Also, there’s a need in Japan for
            the
            gospel, and knowing their native language could be of great help to share with them our faith.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-title">Music</h3>
        <p> I’ve always loved music, and there’s nothing like making it with your own hands. In the past I tried to
            leave music, I avoided playing piano and other instruments, but I just couldn’t, I ended up getting back
            to
            the black and white keys, which help me to be in peace with my soul. Not to mention that music is use to
            praise God, and how would I restrain myself from praising Him with such wonderful tool He has given us. So,
            as long I breath I
            must
            keep playing and improving to give Him my best.
        </p>
