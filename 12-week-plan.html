        <h2>My 12 week plan</h2>
        <p>To accomplish my biggest goals, I must first tackle some smaller, yet important goals.</p>
        <p>So, I've set some goals to accomplish in those next 12 weeks, that will help me get closer to the big ones.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-title">12 week goals</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Make projects using React (learn React)</li>
                <li>Understand Japanese <br>
                    (listen to 2.500 min of only Japanese content, and learn 420 new words)
                </li>
                <li>Play Love sorrow (piano piece)</li>
                <li>Do 160 push-ups</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Tactics</h2>
            <h3 class="sub-title">React</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Week 1 finish JS course</li>
                <li>Week 2 and 3 complete HTML & CSS advanced course</li>
                <li>Weeks 4-12 complete React course</li>
                <li>Each week study/build at 10 hours per week</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm almost done with the JS course, but there are some projects that I haven’t finished yet, so I'll be
                working the first week on those.</p>
            <p>Before starting learning React I also have to do an HTML & CSS advanced course, and I hope
                to complete it in no more than 2 weeks.</p>
            <p>I'll be studying 2 hours from Monday to Friday, an at lest 1 hour weekends. This is the only task that
                I'll do at the same hour everyday. I set to study/build from 5:30am to 7:30am each day.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-title">Japanese</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Listen 30 minutes of only Japanese content everyday</li>
                <li>Learn 5 words everyday</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At the moment of writing there (just one day before starting) I know almost 300 Japanese words, at the
                end of the 12 week I should have a vocabulary of at least 700 words.</p>
            <p>Also, I'll spend 2500 minutes actively listeting to native Japanese content.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-title">Do 160 push-ups</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Increment 5 push-ups every week</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I can do around 100 push-ups in a session, but I want to increase that, and the only way to do it’s being
                more consistent, so this will push me to not skip any workout day.</p>
            <p>I’ll do push-ups Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The days between will be to do stretches, that my body
                do need.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-title">Play Love Sorrow</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Learn a page every two weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pages is not like a good measure to know how good are you learning some music, but it’s the only way now
                I have.</p>
            <p>I already know the first 2 pages of 10, so I have 8 pages left to learn.</p>
